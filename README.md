# Big data analysis

Code from my Big Data Analysis classes at AGH University of Science and Technology.

Labs were about Apache Spark and its ecosystem:
1. Spark RDD - low-level Spark API
2. Spark SQL - high-level Spark API, Spark DataFrame
3. AWS EMR - Spark clusters in the cloud, scaling computations
4. Spark Streaming - proc
5. GraphX - graph processing (in Scala language)
6. MLlib - large scale machine learning
